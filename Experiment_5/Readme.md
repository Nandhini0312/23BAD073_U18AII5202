In-Lab Tasks
1. Design KPI Cards

Purpose: To provide quick, visual insights on key metrics.

Implemented KPIs:

Attendance: Shows the overall attendance percentage of students.

Performance: Displays average scores or grades of students.

Design Features:

Large font for metric values (14–18 pt)

Bold text for labels

Light fill colors (soft yellow/blue) for visual distinction

Borders around each KPI card for clarity

2. Implement Filters

Purpose: To allow users to analyze data by specific categories.

Filters Included:

Department Filter: Select a department to view only relevant student data.

Semester Filter: Choose a semester to analyze performance and attendance trends.

Implementation: Slicers were added in Power BI and linked to the respective visualizations for interactive filtering.

3. Link Multiple Views for Drill-Down Analysis

Purpose: To enable detailed exploration of data from summary to granular levels.

Implementation:

Multiple charts (bar, line, and column charts) were linked.

Drill-down functionality allows users to click on a category (e.g., department) and view detailed metrics (e.g., semester-wise attendance and scores).

Benefit: Enhances decision-making by providing both overview and detailed insights.
