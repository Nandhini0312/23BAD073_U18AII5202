Traffic Accident Data Visualization Using R

Objective

To analyze and visualize traffic accident data using appropriate visual encodings in order to identify accident severity patterns, frequency distribution, and accident types.

Dataset Description

The dataset contains records of traffic accidents with attributes such as location, accident severity, accident type, and accident identifiers. These attributes are used to explore spatial and categorical patterns in accident occurrences.

Tools and Libraries Used

R Programming Language

ggplot2

Experimental Tasks

Severity Analysis: Accident severity is encoded using a color gradient to highlight varying levels of severity across locations.

Frequency Analysis: Accident frequency is represented using bar charts to identify high-risk locations.

Accident Type Analysis: Different accident types are visualized using shape-based encoding to compare patterns across locations.

Conclusion

The experiment demonstrates how visual variables such as color, size, and shape can effectively represent complex traffic accident data, enabling better interpretation and supporting data-driven decision-making for traffic management.
