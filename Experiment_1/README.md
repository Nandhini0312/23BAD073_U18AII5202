Student Performance Analysis Using R
Objective

To analyze and visualize student academic performance using R in order to identify subject-wise average marks, performance trends, and grade distribution.

Dataset

The dataset X1_student_performance contains student academic details including internal test scores, assignment marks, and final grades.

Tools Used

R Programming Language

ggplot2

dplyr

tidyr

Experimental Tasks

Computation of subject-wise average marks and visualization using a grouped bar chart.

Analysis of performance trends across internal tests using a line plot.

Visualization of final grade distribution using a pie chart.

Conclusion

The experiment demonstrates the application of R for academic data analysis and effective visualization of student performance metrics.
